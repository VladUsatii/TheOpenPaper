Product is a mass AI and subsidiary-specialized social media application available on the world wide web, including users, posts, notifications, profiles, user and post search, tags, picture posts, blog posts, a marketplace, weather, and so so much more. In fact, it had so much, I stopped adding to it because the user retention rate was plummmeting.

Check out the Business & Ads Section to learn about my ad algorithm implementation in vanilla Jinja. I used Python's Django and BeautifulSoup4 framework to put together a beautiful online experience.

*One of the challenges in creating a new social media is the reputation that they have in 2021. They are known to capture all focus, time, and attention span from the average individual, and the added 'clean' finish to pages isn't doing anyone any favors. To combat major monopolistic behaviors between the big four, I designed a site that holds 10 items on a page, encourages writing and editing, has a strict be-honest policy, and encourages expression.*

## What usatii Learned with Product's Development

The best ideas come from individuals who are troubled with the current system of a specific category. To help innovate, Product was designed to encourage blogging and reduce the complexity and addiction factor of modern social networks. Direct messaging was removed, along with reducing notifications, removing 'ping' sounds, and working with research into A.G.I. to provide a fast and user-friendly experience -- no more time-wasting 'Recommended' feeds.

We learned:
* Jinja2
* Django
* PHP
* HTML/CSS/JS/React/TypeScript
* cv2
* Numpy
* Python2
* Pandas
* Matplotlib.pyplot is a very important statistical hub tool for aggregation
* Coq IDE for proofing
* Django REST Framework
* Mapbox API
* Socket

* Learning Information Theory is just as important as learning a good algorithm
* Django works for small codebases like ours
* cv2 is a powerfully silent add-on in Django
* Jinja Templating Engine has more buffer attack possibilities than simply designing a JavaScript app

The following were big inspirations for Product:
* 'Let's imagine that one day, hypothetically, someone created a Twitter 2.0' -- Lex Fridman
* 'I just don't think that Twitter spreads positivity anymore' -- Joe Rogan
* 'I think there will come a time in the future (2050's, even) when we just stimulate our pleasure centers out of pure boredom because these social medias have gotten too old' -- George Hotz

## Ads & Tracking

The best part of this site was abolishing the old 'Facebook-type' way of storing user data and replacing it with the 'Product-type' way of storing user data. We track only essential information that can help advertisers get to the correct audience, but we don't sell info in packages to companies.

Data is an important part of this project and learning how to query and sort it was a breakthrough in my coding knowledge.

## Django

Built with Django, it contains everything that Django has to offer (except for the REST framework), and we are even extending it to a React frontend in the near future.
